Initially intended to be a full game, but currently only works as a map generator.

Procedural generation is used to create a single hexagonal mesh grid.

Elevation, terrain type, water level etc. all vary based on environment types.

Oceans are created with a graphics shader and it also customisable.

Made before I properly understood git, hence the enclosing folder and lack of commits...
